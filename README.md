# boletin_scrapper
Aims to scrap links from websites such as the OECD, IMF, World Bank for papers and other publications for a given month. Placing the link within a word or excel file for easy access. 

# How to use 

Run the following command in the terminal. 
```python
flask run 
```
Or simply start off the program by running app.py either by using the UI in VS code or executing the python script in the terminal.
```python
python app.py

python3 app.py #In case the previous command did not work. 
```
You'll be able to preview any progress made by the program directly in the terminal. Be patient. It can take a while so do not stop the script unless an error has occurred.

Finally, you'll be given the option to open a new tab in your browser where you will be able to see the final result. 

The program can either work as a standalone script or deployed as a web app where the scrapper will take charge of updating itself every four hours.
